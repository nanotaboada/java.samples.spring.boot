                        industries. Learning how to write effective Java code can take your career to \
                        the next level, and The Java Workshop will help you do just that. This book is \
                        designed to take the pain out of Java coding and teach you everything you need \
                        to know to be productive in building real-world software. The Workshop starts by \
                        showing you how to use classes, methods, and the built-in Collections API to \
                        manipulate data structures effortlessly. You'll dive right into learning about \
                        object-oriented programming by creating classes and interfaces and making use of \
                        inheritance and polymorphism. After learning how to handle exceptions, you'll \
                        study the modules, packages, and libraries that help you organize your code. As \
                        you progress, you'll discover how to connect to external databases and web \
                        servers, work with regular expressions, and write unit tests to validate your \
                        code. You'll also be introduced to functional programming and see how to \
                        implement it using lambda functions. By the end of this Workshop, you'll be \
                        well-versed with key Java concepts and have the knowledge and confidence to \
                        tackle your own ambitious projects with Java.""");

                        Spring Boot as their default framework. With this book, you'll learn how to \

                        Starting with a set of simple cooperating microservices developed using Spring \

                        and traffic management. Finally, you'll explore centralized log management using \
                        the EFK stack and monitor microservices using Prometheus and Grafana. By the end \
                        of this book, you'll be able to build microservices that are scalable and robust \

                        and introductory resources can help you learn the basics of Kotlin, the fact \

                        implementing practical design patterns and best practices to help you master the \
                        Kotlin language. By the end of the book, you'll have obtained an advanced \
